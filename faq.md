### Cloud or on-premises?
Powerlynx is fully cloud-based software. We do not offer the option to install it on your own server separately.

### Do you provide a trial to test your software?
Yes, we offer a 21-day trial so you can evaluate the Powerlynx software and determine if it suits your needs.

### Pricing
You pay $25 for every 100 online customers. For example, if you plan to host 800 online customers, your cost will be $200. Your system can accommodate up to 810 online customers. Any additional customers beyond that limit will not be able to connect.

### What payment gateways do you support?
We are continually adding new integrations with payment gateways worldwide. Currently, we support PayPal, Stripe, Payfast(South Africa), Pay@ (South Africa) and Safaricom MPESA (Kenya).

### What network devices do you support?
