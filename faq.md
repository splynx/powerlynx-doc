# Frequently asked questions

#### Cloud or on-premises?
Powerlynx is fully cloud-based software. We do not offer the option to install it on your own server separately.

#### Do you provide a trial to test your software?
Yes, we offer a 21-day trial so you can evaluate the Powerlynx software and determine if it suits your needs.

#### Pricing
You pay $25 for every 100 online customers. For example, if you plan to host 800 online customers, your cost will be $200. Your system can accommodate up to 810 online customers. Any additional customers beyond that limit will not be able to connect.

#### What payment gateways do you support?
We are continually adding new integrations with payment gateways worldwide. Currently, we support PayPal, Stripe, Payfast(South Africa), and Safaricom MPESA (Kenya).

#### What network devices do you support?
By default, we support Mikrotik and Cambium network devices that can connect to Powerlynx using the RADIUS protocol. While it is possible to connect other devices through the RADIUS protocol, it may require some configuration adjustments.
