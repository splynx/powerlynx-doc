### Do I need to connect SMS gateways to Powerlynx in order to send SMS?

Powerlynx does not come with an in-built SMS gateway. You'll need to connect third-party SMS gateways to Powerlynx. For more information on supported SMS gateways, please refer to the [forum](https://forum.powerlynx.app/t/sms-gateways-in-powerlynx/40) and [documentation](https://docs.powerlynx.app/system/sms.html).


### Can I connect my access point to Powerlynx?

Yes, you can connect your access point (AP) to Powerlynx. However, you need to have a hotspot controller, such as a Mikrotik router or Cambium router.

The general requirement for a hotspot controller is support for RADIUS and hotspot functionalities.

Mikrotik routers are relatively inexpensive and make excellent hotspot controllers. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. Connect the Hotspot Controller to Powerlynx: Follow the detailed guide available at [How to connect your Mikrotik with Powerlynx](https://docs.powerlynx.app/networking/mikrotik.html).

2. Connect APs to the Controller: After connecting your Mikrotik to Powerlynx, you can connect your APs (e.g., TP-Link, Ubiquiti) to the Mikrotik router using VLANs (for example).

3. Set Up Hotspot Server on Each VLAN Interface: Configure a hotspot server on each VLAN interface to efficiently manage and monetize your WiFi network through Powerlynx.
