# Reports

It is important to export data and generate reports to analyze different metrics of your business. In Powerlynx, we offer a data export feature that you can use to export sessions and vouchers, helping you better understand usage, popular plans, etc.

To use this feature, navigate to `Analytics -> Reports` and select the report you need:

![Reports](images/reports.png){data-zoomable}

To generate a report, simply click on the "Create a new report" button, select the type of report, and use filters to export more precise data:

![Generate a report](images/generate_report.gif#mediumsize){data-zoomable}

Wait on this page until the "Download" button appears:

![Report result](images/vouchers_export_result.png){data-zoomable}

Or safely navigate away and come back later to the list of reports. You will see the "Download" button under the generated report.

The output file is a CSV containing all the required and filtered data.
