# Data plans

Data plans are offering subscription templates describing how customers can access the network and what limitations they will have.
Limitations can be network speed, traffic amount limitations, online time, and plan availability depending on the day of the week or time.

You can view the list of all data plans and create a new one on the **Data plans** main menu section.

## Enabled data plans available for location

Customers can select data plans or buy using [payment gateways](/todo) on the [splash pages](/todo) while trying to connect to Wi-Fi. For this, you should enable plans for the location.
To enable a data plan for a location, go to the **Locations** section location where you want to enable/disable the plan, click on the **Plans** tab, and enable or disable data plans using checkboxes **Enabled** to select the plans you want to allow for this location.
