# Vouchers

### What is a voucher in Powerlynx?

In Powerlynx, a voucher functions like an access card, generated by the system to grant users network access under specific conditions. Each voucher contains detailed information about its validity, traffic limits, online time limits, and the maximum number of devices that can connect using it.

### Voucher Creation and Usage Process:

1. **Creating Data Plans:** First, you create a data plan under the Data plans menu with specific limits. For example, you might set a plan with a 10 Mbps upload/download speed, a 1 GB traffic limit, a 1-hour online limit, and a validity of 7 days.

2. **Enabling Data Plans at Locations:** Next, you enable this data plan for a specific location.

3. **Customer Interaction:** When a customer at that location connects to Wi-Fi, they are redirected to a page where they can select a data plan that suits their needs.

4. **Voucher Generation:** Upon selecting a data plan, a new voucher is created with limits as defined in the chosen data plan.

5. **Monitoring and Deactivation:** The system continuously monitors the voucher. If any of the set limits are reached (such as the traffic limit or time online), the system deactivates the voucher and disconnects the customer.

### Example scenario

Consider a café using Powerlynx to manage its Wi-Fi service. The café wants to control Wi-Fi usage to prevent network abuse. They set up several data plans with different limits and enable these plans for their location.

When a customer orders a coffee, they connect to the Wi-Fi and are prompted to choose a data plan. Suppose they choose a plan with a 1-hour online limit, 1GB data, and 10 Mbps speed, valid for 7 days. As soon as they select the plan, a voucher with these specific limits is generated. If the customer reaches the 1GB data limit or exhausts their 1-hour online time within these 7 days, the voucher is automatically deactivated, and the connection is terminated.

This system ensures fair usage of the café's Wi-Fi and offers the flexibility for customers to choose a plan that best suits their needs, while also providing the café with efficient management and monitoring capabilities.

### Explaining the Vouchers menu

You can find the Vouchers menu on the dashboard, located between the Customers and Finance menus:

![Dashboard-Vouchers](images/dashboard_vouchers.png){data-zoomable}

It includes three sub-menus:

1. **Series** - A list of vouchers grouped by series. Each series can contain thousands of vouchers, and we use them to group vouchers created from the same tariff plan during a specific time period:

All series are created automatically. However, in some cases, you may need to create a series of fresh vouchers that can be printed. This can be done using the "Generate" button, which opens a form where you can set parameters for a new series:

![Vouchers-Series-Generate](images/serie-generate.png){data-zoomable}

In this example, we generate a series of 5 vouchers from the "Free for Employees" plan, which are designated for use at the "Hotel" location. These vouchers remain valid until the end of their specified validity period. After generation, you will have 5 vouchers that can be utilized in the "Login with Voucher Code" option on a splash page.

Each serie has 4 actions: 
- Edit - Modify certain parameters of a series;
- View - Display the list of vouchers in this series;
- Export - Export the list of vouchers in this series;
- Delete - Remove the series. 

2. **List** - this page contains the list of all vouchers in the system:

At the top of the list, under the "Filters" tab, we automatically apply a filter by status: Active and Online, to facilitate easier browsing.

3. **Online** - The list includes ONLY online vouchers along with their statistics, IP, MAC, hotspot, and location details.

You can disconnect all sessions of these vouchers using the button in the "Action" column.
