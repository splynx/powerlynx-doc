# Mass SMS

The Mass SMS Sending feature in Powerlynx enables you to send targeted text messages to groups of users in just a few clicks. By combining this with the Target Groups feature, you can ensure your message reaches exactly the right audience based on demographics, behavior, or any custom data you’ve collected.

## What Is Mass SMS Sending?
Mass SMS Sending allows you to broadcast messages to multiple users simultaneously. Instead of messaging your entire user base, you can focus on a specific segment—improving engagement and reducing costs.

### This feature is ideal for:

1. Promotions and discounts

2. Announcements (e.g., new products or services)

3. Loyalty campaigns

4. Event reminders

5. Feedback requests

## How It Works

You can edit campaigns with the status set to "Scheduled" if you need to change any parameters. If the status is "Sent", you can only view the list of recipients and the delivery status of the SMS messages from that campaign:
