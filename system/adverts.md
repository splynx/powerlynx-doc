# Adverts

This module is a vital component of our system, aimed at boosting user engagement by presenting video and image ads to end users once they connect to the Wi-Fi network. The Adverts module provides advertisers with a distinctive opportunity to effectively reach their target audience and track the number of times an ad is displayed to customers. Within this documentation, you'll discover comprehensive guidance on setting up and managing ad campaigns, analyzing performance metrics, and optimizing ad delivery to maximize impact.

# Create an ad campaign

To create an ad campaign navigate to the `Adverts` module and click the "Add" button:

This action will open a form where you can configure your campaign:

![Create](images/create_video_a.png){data-zoomable}

In this example, we created the 'Powerlynx' ad campaign, which is active from 2024-04-11 to 2024-04-30, across two locations that share the same splash page. The ad type is video, and you can upload a video with a maximum size of 100 MB, with no restrictions on its extension. We will be using the .MP4 video format.

Once created, you will see the parameters that can be modified and the uploaded video. You may also notice a new field called 'Ad view counter,' which displays the number of views for this specific ad:

![Created](images/created_a.png){data-zoomable}

Let's see what the user see after the connecting to a WiFi:

![Video ad](images/video_a.gif#mediumsize){data-zoomable}

As you can see, the video ad was displayed to the customer after selecting a plan, with no option to skip it. The customer must watch the video in its entirety to gain access to the internet.

If you want to add an image ad, you'll need to set up the ad duration in seconds. This option determines how many seconds the image will be displayed:

![Image ad](images/image_a.png){data-zoomable}

In the same manner as with video ads, after connecting to Wi-Fi, the customer will need to wait for 6 seconds before gaining access to the internet:

![Image ad example](images/image_a_example.jpeg#mediumsize){data-zoomable}

You can view your campaign statistics below this counter:

::: info
If you set up multiple ads for the same location, they will be displayed randomly to the customer.
